**Truly Learning Design Patterns**

So enough is enough and I’ve decided to just truly learn the most important design patterns, this only be light practice to complement my studies

Some Key things to know about this repo:
  1. Just because a pattern is not here doesn’t mean I haven’t learned it, maybe I haven’t had time to write an example of my own
  2. The example are supposed to be really simple; this is just to demonstrate in a really simple way how to use the patterns
  3. I’ll try to keep the repo updated
  4. Don’t promise anything though
  5. The two main sources of information will be:
     - The famous GOF book, the one that originally introduce the pattern to OOP
     - [This playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc&si=uftDzkcaLjMFGj78) of right now my favorite programming/coding youtuber.
